## Transformation Plan
Converting from movie-focused Letterboxd clone to restaurant-focused WaterFood app:
1. Replace movie terminology with restaurant terminology
2. Replace TMDB API with Google Places API
3. Implement aggressive caching to stay within 10k API calls/month
4. Add restaurant-specific features (Google + community ratings, etc.)
5. Maintain social features but adapt for restaurant context
